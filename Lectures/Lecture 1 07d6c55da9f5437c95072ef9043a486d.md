**Network Applications**

- Read and write data over network
- Dominant model : Bi-directional reliable byte stream connection
    - Two computers run program locally that helps them communicate over the internet
- Byte Stream Model
    - **B Computer - Waiting for connections**
    - **A Computer - Send the invite for the connection, setups a connection**
    - **A write data to B which travel over the network and vice-versa**
    - **Either side can close the connection(A or B)**
- **World Wide Web**
    - uses HTTP - **Hyper Text Transfer Protocol**
    - Client opens a connection to server and send the request
    - Most common request is **GET**
    - Document centric way to communicate
    - Server receives & validates the requests and sends the response
    - Response sent via numeric code along with data if its successful
- **Bit Torrent**
    - Client request documents from other clients
    - Single client can request documents from many other clients in parallel
    - **Breaks files into Pieces** and once client has complete piece its tells other client that it can download from them
    - The **collection of collaborating clients are swarms**
    - Uses same mechanism as WWW - a reliable bi-directional byte stream but in a slightly complicated way
    - Uses torrent file which has basic information about the torrent - **tracker**
    - **Tracker is one who keeps the names of clients that a members of the swarm** of the particular data that we are looking for
    - Client sends request to tracker to get list of clients- swarms
    - Then client sends request to those clients for data
    - When new client joins, the trackers notifies the other clients of the change and allows the client to exchange data between them
- **Skype**
    - Both are clients exchanging data between themselves instead of client-server model
    - Each device is behind a Network Address Translator - **NAT,** used by every devices across the internet - router, mobile phone
    - if you are behind **NAT then you can open connection outside to the internet but others can’t easily open connections to you**
    - To workaround this problem, skype uses rendezvous server
    - Client B opens connection rendezvous server, then Client A tell its want to connect to Client B
    - Client B gets a call popup which then connects to Client A in Internet. This is called reverse connection, since the expected direction is reversed.
    - But this doesn’t work both Client A and Client B are behind NAT. So to workaround this Skype introduced new server called Relay
    - Client A and Client B connect thru Relay Server which is not behind NAT and communicate between them.
