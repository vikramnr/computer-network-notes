### Principle : Packet Switching

- **Packet**
    - A self contained unit of data that carries necessary information for it to reach its destination
- In the simplest form of packet switching, each packet is routed separately and independently.
- **Packet Switching**
    - ****Independently for each arriving packet, pick its outgoing link.
    - If the link link is free then send it, else hold the packet for later.
- For example of how packet switching can work,
    - each packet contains an explicit route, specifying the ID’s of each packet switch along the way.
    - this is called self routing or source routing, because the source specifies the entire route for the packet to reach its destination.

- This method is generally switched off due to security concerns.
- To prevent this one simple opmtimization is to place a small amount of state in each switch which tells it which next hop to send the packets to.
- In this model, all the packet needs to carry is the destination address. Using the destination each switch along the way can make the right decision.
- **Two properties of packet switching**
    - Simple packet forwarding - simplfiyes the switch
        - Switch can make invidividual local decisions about each packet
        - Doesn’t care about the type of packet or  its part of large trasnfer protocol i.e skype call or web request
        - Doesn’t keep extra state in packet or when the two packets go to the same destination
    - Efficient sharing of links
        - For example, a wireless router in home being used by two people where one person is browsing a page and another one is downloading a file
        - Link can then use the full speed to file download and when the other person has to visit another page the link can be shared between them.
        - Once the user gets the page, the link again can dedicate its full speed to the file download
    - **No per flow state requried**
        - **Flow : A collection of datagrams belonging to the same end-to-end communication eg. TCP Connection**
        - Packet switches doens’t need state for each flow - each packet is self contained
        - No per flow state to be added or removed - for example when sending web request if state has to be established across each switch then things would be much slower.
        - No per flow state to be stored
        - No per flow state to be changed upon failure - for example when tablet send a request and then loses battery, switch doesn’t need to worry about the dead connection. It just stop reciveing packets from the source.
    - **Efficient Sharing of Links**
        - Data traffic is bursty - we download a page and then visit another page —→ Download few songs and the listen to them. → — →Stream movie and then visit another page
        - Rather then sending and recieveing data at a fixed rate, usage jumps and drops, goes up and down over time.
        - The way in which links get shared between users when the use at the same time and full speed is given when other users in the link are idle is called **Statistical Multiplexing**
        - Packets switching aloows flows to user all avalible link capacity
        - Packet switching allows flows to share link capacity.
