### Life of a Packet

- **Application : Stream of Data  → Transport : Segements of Data → Network: Packets of Data**
- **TCP Byte Stream**
    - Client initiates the connection to server with help of messages
    - Three messages to initiate a connection - three way handshake
        - Client issues  - First step of the message is when the clients sense to synchronize message **- SYN message**
        - Server ack., and sends message back to the client call Synchronize and acknowledge - **SYN/ACK**
        - Client responds then with Acknowledging the service synchronize sending acknowledge message - **ACK**
    - Opening TCP stream requires two adresses - IP Address and TCP Port
        - IP Address tells which computes to send the data, which then helps network layer to send packets of data
        - Port tells us which applications will send\recive the data
        - Web servers will usually run on PORT 80
    - **Inside Each Hop**

    - Data send from computer hops thru router to reach its final destination
    - Each router is then connected to number of routers, which then will take the data and send it to the final destination.
    - As data arrives router then decides which of its interconnected routes - **links should it send out the data to.**
    - Router makes this decision based on the **forwarding table,**  which has **several forwarding entry patterns and its link address**
    - **Default route is least specific route and when there is more specific route to forward the packet,** router will use the default route.
    - Default router is useful in edge networks, where for example the stanford university doesn’t have link to particular department then it must forward it to large network of the area
