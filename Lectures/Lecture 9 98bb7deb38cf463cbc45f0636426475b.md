## Names and Addresses : IPv4

- Initial Goal for IP Adresses
    - Stich many different networks together
    - Need network-independent, unique address
- A IPv4 address identifies a device on the Internet
    - 32 Bits long - 4 octets → a.b.c.d → 4, 8 bit segments
    - 171.64.64.64, 128.30.76.82, 12.22.58.30
- A device also has a **Netmask - tells you which IP address are local**, which are same link or network and which one requires going thru the router
- For example, a laptop and another device connected in same network doesn’t need to go thru an router
- A netmask is writtern as string of consecutive ones starting with Most Significant Bit
    - Netmask of 255.255.255.0 → 24 bits long
    - Netmask of 255.255.252.0  →22 bit long
    - If the bitwise of A and B and their address with the netmask are equal, then they are on the same network
- **Address Structure Today**
    - Old Structure has three Classes
        - Class A - network -7 bits - 128 network, host - 24 bits - 16 million computers
        - Class B - network - 14, host -16 bits - 65536 computers
        - Class C - network -21, host -8 bits - 256 computers
    - Today IPv4 address are structured thru **CIDER - Classless Inter Domain Routing**
        - Address block is a pair - address, count
        - Counts are power of 2, specifying the mask length
        - 171.64.0.0/16 → refers to address ranging from 171.64.0.0 to 171.64.256.256
        - A/24 → refers to 256 address, a/24 → refers to 4096 address in total
- **Address Managment is done by IANA** whose ultimate authority resides with ICANN
    - IANA gives /8 block address to Regional Internet Registries - RIR
    - Each region has its own RIR →AfriNIC, ARIN,  APNIC, LACNIC, RIPE NCC
