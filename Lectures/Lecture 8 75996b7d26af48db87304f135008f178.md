## Memory, Byte Order and Packet Formats

- **Compuer Memory -** Each time a application wants send information over the internet, it sends it thru network card.
- Network cards stores it in the memory before sending it over the network
- When the end host recieves the information, the network card then puts the information in the memory which then can be accessed by the computer.
- Endianess - How do you arrange the bytes in the memory
    - **Little endian** - least significant byte is at the lowest address
        - 1024 - 0x00 0x04 - (LSB)(MSB)
        - Makes sense from addressing/ computational standpoint
    - **Big endian -** most significan byte is at the lowest address
        - 1024 - 0x04 0x00 - (MSB)(LSB)
        - Makes most sense to human reader
- **Network Byte Order -** Two computers communicating over network must agree on common format
    - Different processers have different endianess
- **Network Byte order is Big Endian**
- Portable code is required to convert between network byte order to processors byte order
- Helper functions are avaliable to convert between the endianess
    - htons(), ntohs(), htonl(), ntohl() â†’ host to network short/long viceversa
- Be careful whenever you handle network data
    - debugging you code due to forgetting to convert or converting twice
