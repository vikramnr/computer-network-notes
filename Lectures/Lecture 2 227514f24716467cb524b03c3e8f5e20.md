# Lecture 2

- Strong similarities between applications send and receiving data
    - Applications do want worry about path or the route the data takes to reach the other end.
    - All applications want to be confident that their data is collectly delivered.
    - Any lost or corrupted data automatically re-transmitted until receieved correctly.
- **Four Layer Model**
    - **(source)** Application → Transport → Network → Link **(bottom)**
    - Internet is made up of end hosts, links and routers
    - Data is delivered hop by hop over links and turns in Packets
    - Packet consists of data that needs to delivered along with a header
    - Header tells the network where the packet is to be delivered, where it came from and so on.
    
    **Link Layer**
    
    - The job of **the link layer is carry the data over one link at a time.**
    - Examples of link layer are wifi and ethernet
    
    **Network Layer**
    
    - The job of **Network layer is delivery packets end to end across the Internet from source to the destination.**
    - It has the job of breaking the data into packets with correct destionation address which is then handed over link layer
    - **(packet)**
        - [DATA]**[FROM][[TO]](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/25OMHX0O9T9CY?ref_=wl_share)(header)**
    - Network layer packets are called **datagrams.**
    - **Network Layer asks the link layer to send the datagram to over one link.**
    - At the other end of the link layer is the Router which agains asks the link layer to transmit it to the next link.
    - Network layer doesn’t concern itself with how Link layer sends it to the next link.
    - This seperation of concern has made Network layer to work easily with different types of link layer. eg., etherenet, WIFI
    
    **IP**
    
    - When transmitting data over the internet i.e in the Network Layer we must use Internet Protocol - IP
    - IP makes best effort to deliver datagrams to other end, but it makes no promises.
    - IP datagrams can get lost, corrupted or sent out of order. There are no guarantees.
    
    **Transport Layer**
    
    - The most common Transport Layer is TCP - **Transmission Control Protocol - (TCP/IP.. most used)**
    - The job of the Transport Layer **is to make sure the packets are delivered to other end of internet in the right order without any loss.**
    - If IP losses one of the packets, TCP transmits them multiple times if need be.
    - If packets are delievered out of order because they have taken different routes to destionation, then TCP collects and deliveres them in the right order.
    - TCP provides services to application that it guarantees correct, in-order delivery data running on top of Network Layer.
    - Some applications doesn’t need correct & in-order delivery of packets - eg., video conferencing application
    - Such applications can use **UDP - User Datagram Protocol.**
    - UDP bundles the applications data and hands it Network layer for delivery. UDP offers no gurantees of delivery.
    - There are many other choices of delivery but these are most used ones.
    - Layering of these services reduces the load on Application end to handle the delivery.
    - Instead they can use well defined API’s which are developed for each layer to transmit the data.
    
    **Application Layer**
    
    - Applications have their own syntax and sementaics of handling the data delivered.
    - For example, application layer can use HTTP to send data to its peer, but it doesn’t care about how transport or network layers sends the data or how many times it does it.
    - **It is like each layer communicates to its peer in the same layer and they don’t care how the other layer got its data.**

**Summary of Four Layer Model**

| Application | Bi-Directional reliable byte stream between two applictions using application specific semantics http, bit-torrent |
| --- | --- |
| Transport | Guarantees correct in-order delivery of data end-to-end. Control Congestion |
| Network |  Delivers datagrams end-to-end. Best effort delivery. No gurantees. Must use IP |
| Link | Delivers data over a single link between an end host and router or between routers. |
- IP is thin waist of internet, since we must IP if need to transmit data over the internet
- Whereas link layer has Ethernet, WIFI, DSL, 3G, LTE etc., and Transport layer has TCP, UDP, RTP etc., and Application layer has http, smtp, ssh, ftp etc.,
- There is also the 7 layer OSI model which then replaced by the four layer model.
